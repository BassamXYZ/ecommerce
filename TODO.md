# Refactor the site with Microservices Architecture :
- User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Product Catalog Service: Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.
- Shopping Cart Service: Manages usersâ€™ shopping carts, including adding/removing items and updating quantities.
- Order Service: Processes orders, including placing orders, tracking order status, and managing order history.
- Payment Service: Handles payment processing, integrating with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, crypto, Syriatel cash, ...).
- Notification Service: Sends email and SMS notifications for various events (e.g., order confirmation, shipping updates). You can use third-party services like Twilio or SendGrid for this purpose.
- AI Assistant Service: ML model to advices customers about what they may need.

- API Gateway: Serves as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. It might be worth looking into Kong, Traefik, or NGINX for this purpose.
- Service Discovery: Automatically detects and manages service instances. You can use Consul or Eureka for service discovery.
- Centralized Logging: Aggregates logs from all microservices for easy monitoring and debugging. You can use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for this purpose.
- Docker & Docker Compose: Containerize each microservice and manages their orchestration, networking, and scaling. Docker Compose can be used to define and manage multi-container applications.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automates the build, test, and deployment process of each microservice. You can use Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for this purpose.
